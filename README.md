## **Project Background**
This project involves analysing sales data from a bike store, consisting of approximately 80,000 records. The aim is to uncover insights into product performance and sales trends. Through data exploration and visualisation, the analysis provides key metrics to support strategic recommendations for improving sales performance and marketing efforts.

## **Executive Summary**
This analysis covers approximately 80,000 records spanning three years (2011–2013), capturing almost $30 million in total bike store sales. Bar a slump in 2012 H1, sales performance has grown significantly over time, with a sharp and sustained increase throughout 2013. Despite consistent growth in the latest year, sales showed volatility across months, indicating possible seasonal or promotional impacts.

Key product insights reveal that Bikes (Mountain, Road, and Touring) are the primary revenue drivers, contributing to 94% of sales (~$15M) in 2013. In contrast, lower-priced items like Tires and Tubes dominated unit sales (~16,000 units), suggesting strong accessory demand. Accessories are also high margin products with an average of 63% compared to the margin of Bikes of 40%.

### Key Recommendations:
1. **Focus inventory and marketing efforts on Bikes**, which drive the majority of revenue.
2. **Investigate month-on-month growth volatility** to understand seasonal trends or campaign impacts.
3. **Leverage high-margin high-volume accessories** (e.g., Tires and Tubes, Helmets, Bottles and Cages) through cross-sells or bundling to increase order value.
4. **Explore promotions or product expansions** during high-growth months to sustain momentum.
